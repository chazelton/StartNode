StartNode
=========

Simple executable to start nodejs.

Use config.xml to set options. documentation in comments. Take particular attention to the overrides to set your node.exe install path as well as other options. StartNode is rather handy in those situations in Windows were you might manage the .exe in some way on startup or other automated tasks. Enjoy and feel free to improve.
